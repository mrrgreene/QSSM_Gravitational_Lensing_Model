# QSSM Gravitational Lensing Model

This repository contains a Python-based model comparing gravitational lensing predictions between General Relativity (GR) and the Quantum Superfluid Spacetime Model (QSSM).

## Purpose

This model allows astrophysicists and cosmologists to compare observed gravitational lensing images (such as those from Hubble and JWST) to predictions made by GR and the QSSM theory.
