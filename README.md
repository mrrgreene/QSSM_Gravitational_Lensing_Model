# Quantum Superfluid Spacetime Model (QSSM) Gravitational Lensing Interactive Model

**Congratulations on making it this far—my theory must have some merit!**

This repository provides a practical, interactive Python tool designed to test predictions of the **Quantum Superfluid Spacetime Model (QSSM)** against observations of gravitational lensing events. QSSM uniquely predicts subtle deviations in Einstein ring geometries compared to General Relativity (GR).

## Core Idea:
QSSM describes spacetime as a dynamic quantum superfluid—the *Elysium Field*—with emergent gravity arising from vacuum coherence. This model predicts observable anomalies in gravitational lensing events distinct from GR.

## How to Test QSSM Yourself:

### Step-by-Step Instructions for Scientists

### 1. Obtain Real Einstein Ring Data
- Access publicly available Einstein ring images from archives such as:
  - [NASA's MAST archive](https://archive.stsci.edu/)
  - [ESA/Hubble Archive](https://esahubble.org/)
  - JWST, Euclid, or SLACS datasets.

### 2. Measure Observational Data
- Open image in **SAOImage DS9** or **ImageJ/Fiji**:
  - Measure **major** and **minor axis** diameters of observed Einstein rings (in pixels).
  - Use the provided pixel scale from image metadata to convert these measurements into arcseconds.

### 3. Run the Interactive Python Script
- Clone or download this repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/mrrgreene/QSSM_Gravitational_Lensing_Model.git
cd QSSM_Gravitational_Lensing_Model
```
- Ensure you have required Python libraries installed:
```
pip install numpy matplotlib
```
- Run the script:
```
python lensing_model.py
```
- Enter the relevant parameters (mass, distances, ellipticities) from published observational data or your own measurements.

### 4. Compare QSSM Predictions vs. Observations
- After running the model, you'll receive predictions for:
  - Major and minor axes (arcsec)
  - Axis ratio and ellipticity
- Create a comparison table similar to:

| Parameter | Observed | GR Prediction | QSSM Prediction | Best Match |
|-----------|----------|---------------|-----------------|------------|
| Major Axis (arcsec) | Measured value | GR result | QSSM result | Better model |
| Minor Axis (arcsec) | Measured value | GR result | QSSM result | Better model |
| Axis Ratio | Measured ratio | GR ratio | QSSM ratio | Better model |

A smaller difference between observed data and predictions indicates a superior model.

## What Your Results Mean
- **If QSSM predictions match observations better than GR:** You've identified empirical support for the Quantum Superfluid Spacetime Model, highlighting exciting new physics beyond standard cosmology.
- **If GR matches better:** Valuable too! QSSM’s parameters may need further refinement, or your data could illuminate conditions under which standard GR still holds precisely.
